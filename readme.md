This is a simple script to create applications using flask. It's a WIP, so I intend to add more plugins and files (e.g. flask-login plugin and flask-principal with implementation, a basic model using pyDAL - and no, I will not use SQLAlchemy).

I created it to make my job easier and automate some stuff, so feel free to fork it, modify, use it, etc. Just don't try to sell it or I'll send you to Mordor to have a very close conversation with Sauron. ;D

usage: python flaskafolding.py "project_name"
